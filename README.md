# Dijkstra's-algorithm

#### Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes in a network

In the shortest path problem, we need to determine the shortest distance from a source to all other nodes or vertices in a
graph. 

**Dijkstra's algorithm** is a very prominent method of solving this problem. This algorithm uses a greedy approach to solve the shortest path problem.
It starts with the source node and finds the rest of the distances from the source node. Dijkstra’s algorithm keeps track of the currently known distance from the source node to the rest of the nodes and dynamically updates these values if a shorter path is found.
